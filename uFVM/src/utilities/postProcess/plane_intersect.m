function [P,N,check] = cfdGetPlanesIntersection(N1,A1,N2,A2)
%plane_intersect computes the intersection of two planes(if any)
% Inputs: 
%       N1: normal vector to Plane 1
%       A1: any point that belongs to Plane 1
%       N2: normal vector to Plane 2
%       A2: any point that belongs to Plane 2
%
%Outputs:
%   P    is a point that lies on the interection straight line.
%   N    is the direction vector of the straight line
% check is an integer (0:Plane 1 and Plane 2 are parallel' 
%                              1:Plane 1 and Plane 2 coincide
%                              2:Plane 1 and Plane 2 intersect)
%
% Example:
% Determine the intersection of these two planes:
% 2x - 5y + 3z = 12 and 3x + 4y - 3z = 6
% The first plane is represented by the normal vector N1=[2 -5 3]
% and any arbitrary point that lies on the plane, ex: A1=[0 0 4]
% The second plane is represented by the normal vector N2=[3 4 -3]
% and any arbitrary point that lies on the plane, ex: A2=[0 0 -2]
%[P,N,check]=plane_intersect([2 -5 3],[0 0 4],[3 4 -3],[0 0 -2]);
